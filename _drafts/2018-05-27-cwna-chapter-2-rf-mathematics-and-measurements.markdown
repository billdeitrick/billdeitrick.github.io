Chapter 3 covers RF mathematics and measurements.

## Objectives

* Apply the basic concepts of RF mathematics and measurement.

## Basic RF Math

* The **watt (W)** is a basic unit of power that is equivalent to one joule per second, or one ampere of current flowing at one volt
    * It's helpful to think of amperes as the flow rate of water in a hose and voltage as the water pressure
    * Outdoor links often utilize power levels measured in watts, while indoor networks use the milliwatt
* The **milliwatt (mW)** is the measurement of power used by many WLAN devices equivalent to 1/1000th of a watt (so 1 watt is 1000 milliwats)
