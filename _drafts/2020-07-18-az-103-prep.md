# AZ-103 Prep: Administer Infrastructure Resources in Azure

## Introduction to Azure Virtual Machines

### Compile a checklist for creating an Azure Virtual Machine

#### Required resources for IaaS Virtual Machines

* IaaS: Manage the platform (operating system, patches, disk space), the application, and the data
* PaaS: Manage the application and the data; not the platform (operating system, patches, disk space...)
* Machines are built from objects that represent things like network, disk space, and have various parameteters applied representing things like operating system, vm name, size...
* VMs can be configured in different sizes, with some optimized for CPU-intensive workloads, some for memory-intensive workloads, etc.
* All machines have at least two disks:
    * Operating System
    * Temporary Disk (loses data when machine is shut down)
* Extra virtual disks or managed disks can be added
* Virtual network interface can offer private IP and, if desired a public IP
    * These are logically isolated from each other, and can be configured for whatever settings might be required to coexist with existing networks
* Resource groups are like buckets that hold related objects that will likely share a common lifecycle (storage accounts, virtual networks, etc)

#### Network

* VNets provide connectivity between Azure VMs and other Azure services, provide external connectivity, and can be configured to connect to on-prem networks
* Network topology is important to consider when connecting to on-prem
* RFC 1918 addresses can be used, or a custom range; overlapping ranges must be avoided
* Once a virtual network address space has been decided, subnets can be created
    * Azure reserves the first four addresses and the last address in each subnet for internal use
* Network security groups (NSGs) are software firewalls that can apply rules at the network itnerface and subnet levels

#### VM Deployment

* It can work well to look at an existing server, take an inventory and think about needs for the VM needs:
    * Communication with other services, open ports, OS, disk space needed, data stored (legal requirements?), CPU, Memory, disk I/O load, burst traffic?
* VM names can be up to 15 chars for Windows and 64 for Linux
    * The vm name defines a manageable Azure resource, and these aren't trivial to change (thus, it's best to come up with a good convention)
    * Convention could use things like environment, location, instance #, product/service, or role
* Azure Resources are manageable items in Azure, such as: the VM, storage account for disks, virtual networks, network interfaces, NSGs, and public Internet addresses
    * Existing resources can be used, or Azure will generate new ones using the VM name
* Distance to users, availability of features, and price differences between locations (these exist!) should be taken into account when choosing a VM location
* VM sizes offer collections of CPU, memory, and storage capacity as bundles: General purpose, compute optimized, memory optimized, storage optimized, GPU, and High performance computes
    * Sizes can be changed, as long s the current hardware configuration supports the new size
    * Running VMs can be resized to a size available in the current hardware cluster on which the VM is running, any size can be available when the VM is deallocated
* Pricing involves distinct compute and storage costs
    * Compute is priced on per-hour basis but billed per-minute; deallocated VMs are not assesed compute charges
    * Azure Hybrid benefit can help save money by re-using existing Windows licensing
    * Storage used by disks is charged whether the VM is running or deallocated since the storage is still required either way
    * Payment options for computer costs:
        * Pay-as-you-go: best for short-term or unpredictable workloads
        * Reserved Virtual Machine Instances (RI): advance purchase, payment made up front for 1-3 years for up to 72% price savings. Best for predictable long-term worlkloads lasting at least one year.
* Storage: aside from the OS and temp storage disk, additional data disks can be added, depending on VM size selection typically two per CPU
    * Data disks allow security, reliability, and performance to be managed separately
    * Data for each VHD is stored in Azure Storage as blobs and charged by the amount of data storage used
* Azure Storage is MS's cloud-based storage solution
    * Storage account provides access to objects in Azure Storage for a specific subscription; a VM will have one or more storage accounts to support attached virtual disks
    * Standard or Premium accounts can be used; Premium uses SSDs and should be used for production
    * Unmanaged disks: You are responsible for the storage accounts used to support the disks
    * Managed Disks: Azure creates the disk and manages the storage account
* Azure can run Window or Linux VMs: base OS images, pre-configured VMs from the Azure marketplace, or custom disk images of 64-bit operating systems

### Exercise - Create a VM using the Azure portal

* Azure Portal, Azure Cloud Shell, and Azure PowerShell module can be used from Mac, Win, or Lin
* The Azure CLI and PowerShell can be used to build automation for IAC (infrastructure as code)
* Template-based tools like ARM Templates, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, and Cloud-init are methods for creating Azure resources using templates

### Options to Create and Manage an Azure Virtual Machine

* Azure Resource Manager
    * Makes working with related resources more efficient; organizes resources into named resoure groups that let you deploy, update, or delete all resources together
    * Resource manager templates are JSON files defining the resources to be deployed for a solution
        * From the VM settings section, templates can be exported for later use or re-used immediately to deploy a new VM based on that template
        * Templates can be useful for creating multiple infrastructure versions...staging and production, etc. Parameterization and combination with the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Azure REST APIs can automate these procedures
* Azure PowerShell
    * Ideal for one-off interactive tasks and/or automation of repetetive tasks
    * The `New-AzVM` cmdlet can be used to create a new Azure VM
* Azure CLI
    * A cross-platform tool for managing Azure resources from the command line
    * Doesn't need PowerShell to function; useful from other scripting languages
* Programmatic (APIs)
    * REST APIs; support interaction with every type of resource in Azure
    * Azure Client SDKs are available for a number of languages to ease developer interaction
* Azure VM Extensions
    * These are small applications that allow configuration and automation of tasks on Azure VMs after the initial deployment
    * Can be run with Azure CLI, PowerShell, Resource Manager templates, or the Azure Portal
    * Can also be bundled with a new VM deployment or run against an existing system
* Azure Automation Services
    * Allows integration of frequent, time-consuming, and error-prone management tasks
    * Process Automation: Set up watcher tasks to correspond to and fix an error condition
    * Configuration Management: manage things like software updates on the VM; think Endpoint Configuration Manager
    * Update management: manages updates and patches for VMs; asses available updates, schedule installation, and review deployments; incorporates services providing process and configuration management

### Manage Availability of Azure VMs

* Availabilty is the percentage of time a service is available for use
* To ensure services aren't interrupted and avoid SPOFs, it's recommended to deploy at least two instances of each VM in an availability set
* An availability set is a logical feature used to ensure a group of related VMs are deployed so they aren't subject to a SPOF and not ll upgraded at the same time during a host operating system upgrade in the datacenter
    * VMs in an availability set should be identical
    * 99.5% SLA for multiple-instance VMs deployed as an availability set
* A Fault Domain is a logical group of hardware in Azure that shares a common power source and network switch; sort of like a single rack
* An Update Domain is a logical group of hardware that can undergo maintenance or be rebooted at the same time
* Azure Site Recovery replicates workloads from a primary site to a secondary location
    * This is about replication of physical or virtual machines to keep workloads available in an outage
    * Azure can be a destination for recovery, eliminating cost and complexity of a secondary physical datacenter
    * Makes testing failover/doing recovery drills easy
    * Can work with Azure resources, Hyper-V, VMware, and physical servers on-prem as a BCDR stragety

### Backup Your Virtual Machines

* Azure Backup is backup-as-a-service protecting physical or virtual machines on-prem or in the cloud
* Possible backup scenarios include: files and folders on Windows, app-aware snapshots (volume shadow copy service), Microsoft server workloads like Exchange and SQL, native support for Azure VMs, and Linux and Windows 10 client machines
* Advantages:
    * Automatic storage allocation/management
    * Unlimited scaling
    * Multiple storage option; local reducancy and/or geo-redundancy
    * Unlimited data transfer
    * Data encryption
    * Application-consistent backup (recovery point has all required data to restore backup copy)
    * Long-term retention (no limit to retention time)
* Utilizes components downloaded/deployed to each computer to be backed up, such as: Aure Backup agent, System Center Data Protection Manager, Azure Backup Server, and Azure Backup VM Extension
* Recovery Services vault stores backup data, backed by Azure Storage blobs
    * Vault allows selection of machines to back up and definition of a backup policy (when snapshot taken/retntion)

# Create a Linux virtual machine in Azure

### Resources used in a Linux VM

* The following resources are used when creating a Linux VM:
    * VM providing CPU and memory
    * Azure Storage account to hold virtual hard disks
    * Virtual disks to hold the OS, applications, and data
    * A VNET to connect to other Azure services or on-prem
    * A NIC to communicate to the VNET
    * An optional public IP

### VM Storage

* Two SSD levels are available: standard and premium
    * Standard offers better performance for normal workloads
    * Premium offers the best performance for I/O intensive workloads on mission-critical systems
* VHDs for Azure VMs are stored as page blobs in an Azure Storage account
* Two types of VHDs will be created for a Linux VM by default:
    * OS Disk: Primary drive, max 2 TB, `/dev/sda` by default
    * Temporary Disk: temporary storage for OS or apps, `/dev/sdb` and formatted/mounted to `/mnt` by the Azure Linux agent. The swap file lives here.
* Data disks are the best place to store data (rather than the OS primary drive)
    * Each disk can hold up to 32,767 GiB of data
    * Azure virtual drives are measured in GiB instead of GB; one GiB is 1.074 GB
    * VHDs can be created from an existing physical disk; this allows migrating existing data to the cloud
* Unmanaged disks require you to manage the storage account.
    * A single storage account can do 20,000 IOPs, and thus can support 40 standard VHDs at full utilization (greater utilization must be spread across storage accounts)
* Managed disks allow Azure to automatically manage the storage account(s) containing them, making them easier to scale out. Several benefits offered:
    * Increased reliability (VHDs placed in different parts of Azure Storage for better resilience)
    * Better security: can used RBAC to control access
    * Snapshot support: snapshots can be used to duplicate or roll back, best to be done on powered-down VM)
    * Backup support: can be automatically backed up to different reasons using Azure Backup
* For VNets, it's often better to create these before the VM and then place VMs into the existing VNets

## Exercise - Decide an Authentication method for SSH

* Can use username/password or SSH key pair (pub/private key)
    * One pub/private key pari can be used to access multiple Azure VMs and services
* Minimum SSH-2 RSA key length is 2048
    * Create key with length 4096: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`
* The `ssh-copy-id` command can be used to copy to an existing VM's authorized_keys file for a given user

## Azure virtual machines IP addresses and SSH options

* By default, Azure public IPs are dynamically allocated. IP address assignment happens when the VM is restarted
* Static IP addresses can be purchased when needed

## Exercise - Connect to a Linux virtual machine with SSH

* Data disks are not intialized with a partition table by default; this should be done from inside the VM on which they are mounted

## Network and Security Settings

* By default, new VMs are locked down: outbound traffic is allowed, but inbound traffic is only allowed from the VNET (local network) and Azure Load Balance (probe checks)
* Creating changes to the firewall requires two steps (if not a common predefined service):
    1. Create a network security group
    1. Create an inbound rule allowing traffic

### Network Security Groups

* Network Security Groups (NSGs): The primaruy tool used to enforce and control network traffic rules at the newtork level; optional security layour providing VNet-level filtering
* Rules are used to allow or deny network traffic
    * Rules identify source/destination, port, direction, priority, and allow or deny
* For inbound traffic, Azure processes the security group associated with the subnet and then the security group applied to the NIC
* For outbound traffic, it's the opposite: Azure processes the security group associated with the NIC first, then the subnet
* If no security group is applied, all traffic is allowed!
* Rules are evaluated in priority order, starting with lowest priority; deny rules stop evaluation
    * Traffic must be able to pass through all applied groups
    * The last rule is always a Deny All -- always an explicit deny
    * Outbound SMTP is a special case and may be blocked; requests can be submitted to change this
* NSGs are resources just like everything else in Azure
