## Objectives

* Understand how the 802.11 standards came about
* Understand who creates the standards
* Understand who manages the radio spectrum

## History of Wireless Communications

* Electromagnetic wave-based (or wireless) communications have been in use for decades
* The first wireless phone conversation took place in 1880; it was called the "Photophone" (used light as the medium) and communicated between rooftops (invented by Alexander Graham Bell)
* Guglielmo Marconi communicated wirelessly (an "S" was the first letter) across the Atlantic in the first decates of the twentieth century; this stirred government and commercial interest in wireless
* Mobile voice technology was perfected and used widely in the 1940s
* A **modem** modulates binary data into analog signals and demodulates the analog signals into binary data
* Early wireless devices were proprietary, so systems from different vendors could not communicate
* The **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)** ratified the first **802.11** standard in **1997**; today this is called 802.11-Prime (1 or 2 Mbps data rates)
* **802.11a (54 Mbps)** and **802.11b (11 Mbps)** were ratified by the IEEE in **1999**


## Industry Organizations

* Three types: regulation (i.e. FCC), standardization (IEEE, IETF) and compatibility/certification (Wi-Fi alliance)
* Mass acceptance comes when regulation, standardization, and compatibility/certification work work together

## Regulatory Domain Government Agencies

* A **regulatory domain** is a geographic area controlled by a set of laws or policies
* In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is the manging Organization


### FCC

* **Hertz** is the specification for radio frequency; it is the measurement of wave cycles per second
* License-free bands for radio communications: **Industrial Scientific Medical (ISM)** and **Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (UNII)**

| Frequency Band      | Total Band Width   | License-Free Band   |
|:-------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
| 2400 - 2500 MHz     | 100 MHz            | ISM                 |
| 5.15 - 5.25 GHz     | 100 MHz            | U-NII (U-NII-1)     |
| 5.25 - 5.35 GHz     | 100 MHz            | U-NII (U-NII-2A)    |
| 5.470 - 5.725 GHz   | 255 MHz            | U-NII (U-NII-2C)    |
| 5.725 - 5.850 GHz   | 100 MHz            | U-NII (U-NII-3)     |

* **Contention** is the process employed by 802.11 WLANs to access the medium for tansmission; this is a normal part of operations. Contention wait times become longer as more stations (STA) access the same channel.
* **Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP)** is a measurement of a system's output power after antenna gain
