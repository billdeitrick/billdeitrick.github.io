## Objectives

* Define/explain basic characteristics of RF and RF behavior

## Electromagnetic Waves

* A **wave** is motion that travels through matter and space
* An **electromagnetic wave** is an oscillation that travels through space, and can even travel in a vacuum devoid of matter
* An **electric field** is the space in which an electrically charged object "feels" a push or pull (depending on whether the charge is like or opposite)
  * The strength of an electric field is measured as the force induced on a unit of electric charge at any given point within the field
* A **magnetic field** is produced by the moving electric charge that is present around a magnet or in free space
  * A changing magnetic field creates an electric field; this is key for the propagation of radio frequencies
* **Radio frequency propagation** describes the way in which waves move through space; electric fields create magnetic fields and vice versa
* **Electromagnetic waves** a combination of electric and magnetic fields propagating through space; the two fields oscillate perpendicular to each other
* A **Radio Frequency (RF)** system relies on electromagnetic wave theory to provide a communications system
* **Modulation** describes the manipulation of an electromagnetic wave to represent data
