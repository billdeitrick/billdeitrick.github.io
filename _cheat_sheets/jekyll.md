# Syntax

## Tables

Jekyll now only has reset styling for tables. An added custom CSS class that can
leverage a custom styling has been added to make tables look a bit more attractive.
This custom class can be added to table via the following inline attribute
(immediately following the table):

```markdown
{: .billtable}
```

# Commands
