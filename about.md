Hi there--thanks for stopping by! My name's Bill; I'm a technologist who's always looking to learn something new. This site is my \[underutilized\] brain dump. When possible, I try to stick notes about technologies I'm using or problems I run into here so that I can find information later or my experience can help someone else. If something is helpful for you or you have any questions, feel free to sound off in the comments section of any page!

Got a question, a suggestion, or something else you'd like to say? Give me a shout!
