Hi there--thanks for stopping by! My name's Bill; I'm a technologist who's always looking to learn something new. This site is my living documentation; I blog about certifications I'm working on, projects I'd like to document, or compile helpful resources. I also have a number of "cheat sheets" I use as quick references for various technologies and platforms. If something is helpful for you or you have any questions, feel free to sound off in the comments section of any page!

Got a question, a suggestion, or something else you'd like to say? Give me a shout!
