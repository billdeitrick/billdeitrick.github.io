Hi there--thanks for stopping by! My name's Bill; I'm a technologist who's currently working on leveling-up my web development skills. This blog contains my documentation of things I've learned along the way, info about some of the projects I've worked on, and other tidbits.

Got a question? Find somewhere that I'm totally off-base? Give me a shout!
