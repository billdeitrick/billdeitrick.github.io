## Choosing your path to Business Ready

* [How to: Plan your Azure AD join implementation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/azureadjoin-plan)
* [Intune enrollment methods for Windows devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/enrollment/windows-enrollment-methods)
* [Enroll Windows devices in Intune by using the Windows Autopilot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/enrollment/enrollment-autopilot)

## Refreshing Devices

* [Factory reset, Fresh start, AutoPilot reset, so many options?!](https://www.petervanderwoude.nl/post/factory-reset-fresh-start-autopilot-reset-so-many-options/)

## Our Process

* [Bulk enrollment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/enrollment/windows-bulk-enroll)
* [Install Windows Configuration Designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/provisioning-install-icd)
* [Fresh start](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/remote-actions/device-fresh-start)

We use these because:
1) Relatively easy to do in bulk
2) Give user device that is ready-to-go (all device-scoped stuff done)
3) Works with older hardware (TPM 1.2)
