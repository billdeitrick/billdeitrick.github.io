# Our Environment

.column-left[
## Church
* PCs, Macs, Chromebooks, and iPads
* ~65 employees
* PC-dominated, moving to mix of above
* Traditional AD environment (with AADConnect); moving to Azure AD/Intune only
]

.column-right[
## School
* PCs, Chromebooks, and iPads
* ~65 employees, ~400 students
* Employees all use PCs, students use Chromebooks (one-to-one for high school) and iPads
* Fully transitioned into an Azure AD-driven environment

# Your Environments

---

# Why Azure AD and Intune?

--

* Best fit for ministry needs within licensing and cost constraints
--

* Better Windows device management: NO MORE IMAGING!! üéâ
--

* SSO for SaaS apps
--

* Mobile Application Management (MAM) 
--

* Device-agnostic, user-driven, available-from-anywhere experience
--

* Most future proof solution

---

# M365: Two Minute Overview

--

* Office 365 ProPlus
--

* Office 365 - E1, E3, E5
--

* Enterprise Mobility + Security (EM+S) - E3, E5
--

* Windows Enterprise - E3, E5
--

* Microsoft 365 (M365) - E3, E5
--

* Our Licensing Strategy
    * Users with org-owned Windows devices: M365 E3
    * Users without org-owned Windows devices: ProPlus, O365 E1, and EM+S
    * Users with no org-owned devices: O365 E1 and EM+S
---

# "Azure AD is not Cloud AD"

--

* Goodbye NTLM, LDAP, Group Policy, and RADIUS; hello web services
--

* Azure AD manages applications
--

* Flat user structure; no more domains, forests, or OUs
--

* Can't customize the directory schema
---

# Groups
--

* Two types of groups: Security and O365
--

* Three membership types: Assigned, Dynamic User, Dynamic Device
--

* Group-based licensing
--

    * Sec-[GROUP TYPE]-[GROUP NAME]
---

# Connecting devices
--

* Azure AD Registered
--

* Azure AD Joined
--

    * Down-Level Logon Name: `AzureAD\FirstLast`
--
* Hybrid Azure AD Joined
---

# Enterprise applications
--

* Administrative control of SSO with third-party apps
--

    * Hundreds of applications in the gallery
    * SaaS vendors and/or Microsoft will typically have documentation
--
* Azure AD as IDP for G Suite
--

    * Google "Cloud Identity Free" licenses
    * Web App Login: "Sign in with Google"
    * Chrome Sync with Azure AD logins
    * Azure AD logins on Chromebooks üòé

# Conditional Access
--

* Configure security controls to apply in specific scenarios
--

* Based on a variety of "signals", such as:
--

    * Group membership
    * IP Geolocation
    * Device (managed or not)
    * Application being accessed
    * Risk detection (depending on license)

---

# üòû Our Pain Points

--

* Security group nesting is...unpredictable
--

* Password changes on AAD-joined devices are...jarring

---

# Intune

* Device configuration profiles
--

    * Assigned to devices or groups of devices (not OUs), not hierarchical like GPO
--
    * Administrative Templates
--
    * Custom Profiles/OMA-URI
--
        * Specify custom OMA-URI and values
--
        * Ingest Custom ADMX
---

# Patching: No WSUS? No problem!
--

* Delivery Optimization
--

* Softare Update Policy
---

# PowerShell Scripts
--

* Intune Management Extension deploys scripts and installs Win32 apps
--

* PowerShell Scripts can be run user or machine-scoped
--

* DO NOT put sensitive data into PowerShell scripts you push with Intune

---

# App Deployment
--

* Types of apps that can be deployed on Windows:
--

    * Microsoft Store apps
--
    * Line of business apps (well-behaved MSI)
--
    * Windows app (Win32)
--
    * Company Portal app

---
# üòû Our Pain Points
--

* App install error codes for Win32, MSI are often...unhelpful
--

* Built-in cloud-based printer deployment solution is...nonexistent
    * Needed third party product (Printix)
--
* Wi-Fi policies will report an error if pushed to a device without a Wi-Fi adapter, which we find...annoying
--

* Reporting intervals are...really slow üê¢
---
# üèÅ Getting Devices "Business Ready"
--

* Azure AD/Intune Integration
--

* Primary choice: User or IT-driven?
--

    * Self-enrollment methods
        * BYOD
        * Azure AD Join
        * Autopilot
--
    * Administrator-based enrollment methods
        * Hybrid Azure AD Join
        * Bulk enrollment
--
* Our process: Bulk enrollment, Fresh Start reset
---
# üç® Random Tasty Tidbits
--

* üîê BitLocker: Key escrow to Azure AD, Intune policy for automatic encryption
--

* üëç Azure AD Sign-in logs
--

* üòé Azure Cloud Shell
--

* üîë Intune: Compliance policies
--

* üì± Mobile App Management

---

# Conclusion: Our Goals

--

* Best fit for ministry needs within licensing and cost constraints
* Better Windows device management: NO MORE IMAGING!! üéâ
* SSO for SaaS apps
* Mobile Application Management (MAM) 
* Device-agnostic, user-driven, available-from-anywhere experience
