### Azure AD/G Suite Notes

* Users must have an Exchange mailbox in order for the email attribute to be populated, since G Suite needs this attribute from the Identity Provider (IDP)
    * If the user doesn't have an Exchange mailbox, they won't be able to sign in to G Suite
* There are some settings you'll want to change to get the best experience on Chromebooks
    * See "[Configure SAML single sign-on for Chrome devices](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6060880)" for more details
    * We've found the best results by enabling Single Sign-on IdP Redirection (Device management > Chrome management > Device Settings > Single Sign-On IdP Redirection)
