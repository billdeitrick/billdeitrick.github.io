1. Introduction
    1. About Me
       1. Professional: Information Services Director for CWC, CS degree from Houghton College, been getting paid to do IT in one form or another for the last 9 years or so; experience working in Higher Ed, a bit in Fortune 500, and NPO
       1. Personal
    1. Overview
       1. Iâ€™m going to be sharing an IT Directorâ€™s perspective on moving from a traditional Microsoft Active Directory environment in a ministry setting to one powered by Azure AD, Intune, and Office 365
          1. Weâ€™ll focus mostly on identity management with Azure AD and Windows device management with Intune
          1. Our Intune discussion will be limited to managing Windows, but weâ€™ll talk about how weâ€™re leveraging Azure AD to provide multi-platform authentication
          1. Not going to talk as much about O365, since many of us are already familiar and are likely living there (at least somewhat) already (and thereâ€™s lots of other opportunity here to learn about O365) 
       1. Goal is to share our experience, and Iâ€™m hopeful that youâ€™ll leave better equipped to apply Azure AD and Intune as appropriate in your environment.
          1. This wonâ€™t be an exhaustive treatment of everything Azure AD and Intune; thereâ€™s just too much to cover
          1. Iâ€™ll try to cover what I think will be most relevant to you, especially focusing on things that surprised us, caught us by surprise, or we found particularly helpful
       1. I am not an Azure AD and Intune expert; Iâ€™m sharing based on my experience in my environment. I donâ€™t know the best practices to apply these tools in every scenario, or the ins-and-outs of every situation.
          1. So, Iâ€™ve asked some of our vendors to join usâ€¦theyâ€™ll be able to provide insights from their perspectives working across many different clients (and, Iâ€™m sure, be quite happy to help you if youâ€™d like some more hands-on assistance getting up and running with these platforms)
          1. I'm also going to try to avoid being "prescriptive" for your environment; I don't feel like I have the experience with these tools in enough environments to make recommendations for yours--I'll leave that to our vendors. I will speak from the perspective of the choices we made and why we made them.
1. ðŸ‘‰Our Environment
   1. Church
      1. PCs, Macs, Chromebooks, and iPads
      1. ~65 employees
      1. PC-dominated, moving to mix of PC, Mac, and Chrome
         1. (We're just starting offer pastors and directors choice of device)
      1. Traditional AD environment (with AADConnect); moving to Azure AD/Intune only
         1. Using Azure AD as auth source for G Suite and Chromebooks (more on this later)
   1. School
      1. PCs, Chromebooks and iPads
      1. ~65 employees, ~400 students
      1. Employees all use PCs, students use Chromebooks (one-to-one for high school) and iPads
      1. Fully transitioned into an Azure AD-only environment
         1. Azure AD and G Suite accounts for all employees and students
         1. Azure AD provides authentication for staff PCs, student ChromeBooks (so students log into Chromebooks using Azure AD credentials)
         1. School used to live in the same AD and Office 365 tenant as the church; this summer we completed moving the school to their own education tenant and moving to Azure AD as central identity source
1. ðŸ‘‰Why Azure AD and Intune?
   1. This audience is no stranger to the draw of SaaS, PaaS, and all of those cloudy buzzwords
      1. So, of course we're attracted by the usual suspects: reduced maintenance overhead, fewer things we have to fix when they break, less time managing infrastructure and more time delivering ministry value
      1. Our specific scenario:
         1. Church and school environments had long shared infrastructure. With licensing changes, and education-focused products from Microsoft, it was time to move the school completely to their own environment with education-SKU products
         1. Originally this move was going to be to two traditional on-prem AD environments with a trust between them
            1. But this felt like overkill. This meant more servers to maintain and license, which felt like moving backwards rather than forwards
         1. Then we considered G Suite and ChromeBooks only for the school (we love the lightweight Chrome experience), but we had major limitations with classroom hardware by going Chrome only, not to mention decades worth of data in Microsoft formats and staff with experience using those tools
            1. So we couldn't get away from PCs...we considered moving identities to G Suite, but we needed PCs and Azure AD doesn't allow identities to be mastered in another platform (and there doesn't seem to be a good solution to this, without introducing other platforms/providers in the mix)
         1. So the conversation came around to Azure AD + Intune, and ultimately moved to a "why not"? After looking hard at Azure AD + Intune and kicking the tires, this seemed like the best solution, giving us the management tools and flexibility we wanted
   1. ðŸ‘‰Best fit for ministry needs within licensing and cost constraints
      1. No need for more servers, best flexibility to provide authentication across variety of platforms
      1. We want to live in a world where we have as small on-prem server footprint as possible (and as much as possible is containerized and lives on hardware someone else owns--but that's a topic for another day); that world includes minimal or no Windows servers on-prem
   1. ðŸ‘‰Better Windows device management: NO MORE DEVICE IMAGING!! ðŸŽ‰
      1. We'd long used FOG for building images...a labor intensive and time-consuming process
      1. With Windows 10 and Intune, and Auto Pilot, we don't need to build images anymore. 
   1. ðŸ‘‰SSO for SaaS apps
      1. Azure AD makes SSO for SaaS apps really easy...like, really easy. This sort of thing used to require major infrastructure and investment.
      1. We love the seamless experience for our users; this goes beyond apps that we've explicitly provisioned for SSO.
      1. Since we're authenticating G Suite against AAD, our users can sign in with their accounts anywhere the see a "Sign in with Office 365" or "Sign in with Google" button
   1. ðŸ‘‰Mobile Application Management (MAM) 
      1. Encrypt and sandbox the organization's data on employee personal devices, centrally manage configuration on those apps (without a need to have the device managed by our MDM)
   1. ðŸ‘‰Device-agnostic, user-driven, available-from-anywhere experience
      1. We want our users to be completely interchangeable with PC, Mac, Chromebook, or a mobile device and be able to sign in with immediate access to all of their data on that platform
      1. We want as much user state to be transferred as possible, so there's relatively little (other than signing in) that a user needs to do to be immediately up and running on a new device
      1. We want the experience across platforms to be as "self-service" as possible--we push apps and settings that are needed by all, users can install what they need themselves (without having local admin unless required by their role)
      1. We wanted to make sure our users have first available-anywhere productivity available. VPN provided this in the past, but there's nothing about the UX I would call "first class". If we don't provide this, our users will go and get it elsewhere (and take our data with them). We have the policy in place, but want it to be an easy one to enforce.
      1. The bottom line: in terms of device management, we want to manage Windows devices more like they're Chromebooks. I think it's clear that, this is ultimately Microsoft's target with Modern managment, and we've found ourselves reaching for Chromebooks as a default less and less becuase of the positive experience with Windows 10 and modern management.
   1. ðŸ‘‰Most future proof solution
      1. All the momentum is with the cloud products at this point; with constant enhancements and licensing changes, it's clear that Microsoft sees their cloud offerings as the path forward for the majority of organizations
1. ðŸ‘‰M365: Two Minute Overview
   1. Microsoft 365 is basically the license that gets you access to all of the Modern Microsoft Management services. We'll talk about the major components here in turn.
   1. Most of you are already familiar with MS NPO offerings, so I won't spend a lot of time here; check out the talk notes for links that will get you started with NPO
      1. Bottom line is, you can expect to pay about 25% of the commercial price for most licenses as NPO
   1. ðŸ‘‰Office 365 ProPlus
      1. Local office apps
   1. ðŸ‘‰Office 365 - E1, E3, E5
      1. The office 365 cloud services
      1. You get the "Office 365" Azure Active Directory plan with an Office 365 subscription; this is a basic version, but if, in addition to O365 logins you just want single sign on for a few cloud services, this is a super-affordable way to do that (limit of 10 SSO apps)
      1. This might be a bridge to the cloud; if you're living fully in the modern stack, you're really going to want ðŸ‘‡
   1. ðŸ‘‰Enterprise Mobility + Security (EM+S) - E3, E5
      1. Intune, Azure Active Directory Premium
      1. This gives you device and identity management in the cloud
   1. ðŸ‘‰Windows Enterprise - E3, E5
      1. This is Windows-as-a-Service--gives you access to perpetual updates on "the last version of Windows"; user-based licensing for Windows 10
         1. In contrast to the traditional volume licensing that we're all used to (being device-based), this is user based
         1. All of the bits for Windows 10 Enterprise are included with Windows 10 Pro; the user's Windows 10 license will unlock the enterprise functionality
      1. Primary difference between E3 and E5 is that E5 also includes Windows Defender ATP
   1. ðŸ‘‰Microsoft 365 (M365) - E3, E5
      1. The total package; includes all of the above
      1. Notable things E5 adds to E3: more advanced security, discovery, and auditing tools, plus phone system
   1. ðŸ‘‰Our Licensing Strategy
      1. We've found E3 licenses to be sufficent for our needs.
         1. Not using phone system (under contract for SIP trunks, which gives end-to-end QoS)
         1. We've found we don't need the more advanced security features (at this point), and we're using third-party AV
      1. ðŸ‘‰Users with org-owned Windows devices: M365 E3
         1. Where we need the Windows license, we reach for the whole suite in one shot via the M365 license
         1. Not sure if this is the case for everyone, but we don't have the option to purchase a standalone Windows 10 Enterprise license in our NPO portal; it only shows up with commercial licenses
            1. So, we reach for M365 to get the Windows Enterprise license
         1. This makes our cost $8.00/user/mo with annual payment ($96.00 yearly)
      1. ðŸ‘‰Users without org-owned Windows devices: ProPlus, O365 E1, and EM+S
         1. Until recently, MS gave away 50 EM+S E3 seats to NPOs (this was replaced with 10 small business essentials licenses Sept. 1). So, we combine these with a ProPlus license for our users running ChromeOS or MacOS
         1. This makes our cost $3.00/user/mo with annual payment ($36.00 yearly)
      1. ðŸ‘‰Users with no org-owned devices: O365 E1 and EM+S
         1. This makes our cost for basic access (email only and cloud apps/authentication $0)
      1. So, of course, this may not be the strategy that is best for your organization to adopt
         1. Number of staff (and having the donated EM+S seats) makes a big difference for us
         1. The point here is, you can go all-in with the kitchen sink M365 license, or mix and match a bit to save ðŸ’°
      1. One note on licensing: you can't license volunteers with donated licenses (unless they're "unpaid full-time equivalent (FTE) staff who have material day-to-day managerial, operational, and fiduciary responsibilities")
         1. At least for us, almost all of our volunteers
         1. There is an E1 license you can purchase for volunteers in the NPO subscription portal; our cost for this is $2.00/user/mo w/ annual payment
         1. Otherwise, Microsoft's recommendation is to invite volunteers as guests
1. Azure Active Directory (AAD)
   1. ðŸ‘‰"Azure AD is not Cloud AD" (Â©?)
      1. If you've Googled any number of search terms relevant to Azure AD, you've probably been bombarded by these advertisements looking to sell you...yet another cloud-based identity service
         1. And it's true...AAD and traditional AD are very different, built to meet different needs in different technology stacks and, ultimately, different eras
         1. Azure AD isn't just traditional Active Directory in the cloud
      1. ðŸ‘‰Goodbye NTLM, LDAP, Group Policy, and RADIUS; hello web services
         1. OAUTH, SAML, OpenID, etc.; these are the languages Azure AD speaks
         1. The traditional AD auth protocols are not part of Azure AD itself. You can get them with another Azure service (called Azure Active Directory Domain Services - ADDS), but in the words of Han Solo, "It's gonna cost you something extra".
         1. At first, I didn't think we could live without LDAP and RADIUS especially; I thought we were going to be jumping directly in with Azure ADDS. 
         1. ðŸ‘‰Two major pain points:
            1. ðŸ‘‰PBX using LDAP for user web portal auth
               1. Web portal user usage is minimal; needed with our system to change speed dials and that sort of thing
                  1. Seldom used, and even more seldom that changes were made; we'll just do this for folks when needed now (we do expect to implement a better solution for this long-term)
            1. ðŸ‘‰WPA2 Enterprise Wi-Fi
               1. NPS/RADIUS auth against AD for employees and AD-joined devices
               1. Printing is really the only thing the "secure" Wi-Fi offered to employee mobile devices that public doesn't; so, we've pushed our employees to open Wi-Fi
                  1. With the proliferation of HTTPS we don't feel that this is nearly as much of a risk as it used to be; the security boundary is moving to the endpoint instead of the network
                  1. We are beginning a Meraki rollout, and Meraki supports web auth against Azure AD and G Suite, so we'll likely head that route in the future for employees (and provided them access to print services over an open network with a web auth portal)
      1. ðŸ‘‰Azure AD manages applications
         1. Azure AD manages "Enterprise Applications"; these are basically SSO-enabled Apps to which you assign users access in AAD
         1. Not really a direct analogue in traditional AD
      1. ðŸ‘‰Flat user structure; no more domains, forests, or OUs
         1. Groups are the only mechanism for, um, "grouping" users, and they do function a bit differently in Azure AD (more on that in a bit)
      1. ðŸ‘‰Can't customize the directory schema
         1. Other than what installing Exchange server I suspect most of folks in this room typically aren't making changes to their directory schema
            1. But, if you were relying on schema extensions you can't do it in Azure AD (and I suspect you'd be hard pressed to find the need to do so)
      1. So thats the 1000 ft. overview of Azure AD from a "vs. AD" perspective; I'll continue to take that perspective and try to hit what we found to be some of the other 
   1. Groups
      1. I mentioned groups function a bit differently in Azure, so let's talk about groups now.
      1. ðŸ‘‰Two types of groups: Security and O365
      1. ðŸ‘‰Three membership types: Assigned, Dynamic User, Dynamic Device
         1. Dynamic User and Dynamic Devices are the interesting ones here
         1. Think similar to Exchange dynamic distribution lists, but for building security or office 365 groups; basically, you build a filter based on directory attributes and the group is populated automatically
         1. Filters use a very Powershell-like syntax
         1. We use dynamic groups in a few different ways...one interesting example is for students--grouping based on elementary, middle, and high school
            1. Last two digits of graduation year are in usernames, so we simply have dynamic groups that look for the usernames containing the appropriate graduation years 
      1. ðŸ‘‰Group-based licensing
         1. Licenses can be assigned to groups instead of individual users; this was released late last year, and we've found this capability to hugely simplify license management! ("You want to turn this on for all of your employees? Ok, one click here please...")
         1. This does, I believe, require an Azure AD premium license
      1. One thing we've found with regards to groups: As a general rule, we try not to use O365 groups as security groups, especially when we're letting users manage membership
         1. This gives users control, without worrying about unexpected side effects like "I don't have access to this third party app anymore" or "I can't access my email anymore"
         1. Instead, we create dedicated security groups to manage access to apps, licenses, traditional SharePoint sites, that sort of thing
            1. This guarantees maximum flexibility for user-managed O365 groups without needing to worry about unexpected consequences
            1. We use a specific syntax for our security groups, so we can easily search for them in the UI (searches start at beginning of group name strings):
            1. ðŸ‘‰Sec-[GROUP TYPE]-[GROUP NAME]
               1. Various group types, such as "Lic" for groups that assign license, "Acc" for groups that give access to resources, that sort of thing
   1. ðŸ‘‰Connecting Devices
      1. In traditional AD this was straightforward; devices were either domain-joined or not
         1. Three types of joins in AAD:
      1. ðŸ‘‰Azure AD Registered
         1. Typically personal devices
         1. A device becomes AAD registered when you use an app on that device to sign in to your organization account in AAD
      1. ðŸ‘‰Azure AD Joined
         1. Closest analogue to devices joined to traditional AD; organization owned, users sign in using Azure AD accounts
         1. Can't directly Azure AD join non-windows devices (say, like Mac to traditional AD)
         1. This is what we're doing; sort of interesting--devices behave somewhat like they're just "workgroup" members, once a user signs in with an Azure AD account it's basically like a local account was created for them
         1. Folder in C:\Users basically becomes FirstLast, downlevel logon name (DOMAIN\username) format becomes:
         1. ðŸ‘‰Down-Level Logon Name: AzureAD\FirstLast
         1. If you're working with the user account locally in any way, say adding to some local group on the machine like Remote Desktop Users, you'll want to use the AzureAD\FirstName downlevel logon name format
      1. ðŸ‘‰Hybrid Azure AD Joined
         1. Joined both to traditional AD and AAD
         1. We did not explore this option in-depth since our goal is to eliminate on-prem AD ðŸ™‚
   1. ðŸ‘‰Enterprise Applications
      1. The primary "killer feature"
      1. ðŸ‘‰Administrative control of SSO with third-party apps
         1. Azure AD was built for providing authentication to third-party apps and platforms
         1. Basically like if ADFS had was rolled directly into (and part of) active directory
         1. Access to applications can be controlled with Azure AD groups, or by assigning access to individual users
         1. ðŸ‘‰Hundreds of applications in the gallery
         1. ðŸ‘‰SaaS Apps and/or Microsoft will typically have documentation
         1. We're moving as much as we can to use Azure AD identities
      1. ðŸ‘‰Azure AD as IDP for G Suite
         1. One of the biggest wins for (on both church and school side) has been setting up our Azure AD tenant as the identity provider for G Suite. This gives us the following on the church side (school/EDU is a bit different):
            1. This is actually fairly straightforward and easy to set up
         1. ðŸ‘‰Google "Cloud Identity Free" licenses
            1. On the church side, we're using a commercial G Suite account (School uses EDU account) with most users licensed using the Cloud Identity Free License
            1. Cloud identity free basically gives you a managed Google account without Google Apps; so, you essentially get all of the Google consumer services minus Gmail, Google Docs, and so on (which you shouldn't need anyway if you're living in O365)
            1. Number of cloud identity free seats you get is related to how many paid licenses you purchase; we have 10 G Suite Business licenses (for certain use cases that significantly benefit from specific G Suite functionality) which gets us ~550 Cloud Identity Free licenses
         1. ðŸ‘‰Web App Login: "Sign in with Google"
            1. Seems like Google as OAUTH IDP is among the most popular; if SSO is supported, you can almost bet Google will be on the list
            1. So, this instantly gets us SSO with web applications all over the Internet
         1. ðŸ‘‰Chrome Sync with Azure AD logins
            1. Gets us complete platform agnosticism in the browser; users can sign into any device or platform and all of their browser preferences, shortcuts, etc. are there and will follow them around
         1. ðŸ‘‰Azure AD logins on ChromeBooks
            1. While we've ended up using ChromeBooks less than we expected (because the Intune experience is so good), we do find they make sense for employees with really basic needs (email, web apps, really basic word processing)
            1. This is notwithstanding one-to-one school scenario where students are using Chromebooks; we've got this in production at this point with ~250 student users since July (and working well so far)
         1. TODO: GIF of Chromebook/Azure Signin
   1. ðŸ‘‰Conditional Access
      1. The second "killer feature" for us...
      1. ðŸ‘‰Configure security controls to apply in specific scenarios
      1. ðŸ‘‰Based on a variety of "signals", such as:
         1. Group membership (or even specific user)
         1. IP Geolocation
         1. Device (managed or not)
         1. Application being accessed
         1. Risk detection (depending on license)
         1. Examples we've implemented:
            1. Require MFA for admins
            1. Require approved apps on Android and iOS devices
               1. Sandboxing of org data on mobile devices via Intune Mobile App Management; conditional access polices are ultimately what make this a requirement
               1. More on this when we talk about Intune
         1. Other examples (some we're planning to implement)
            1. IP Geolocation blocking
            1. Block off-campus sign ins for groups that don't sign in from off-campus
            1. Require MFA from all employees
   1. ðŸ‘‰Our Pain Points
      1. ðŸ‘‰Security group nesting is...unpredictable
         1. Some places it works exactly as you'd expect, other places it just doesn't work; group members from nested groups simply aren't there
         1. In traditional AD, we had worked hard to move everything to role-based access; if you were, say, a Receptionist, we assigned you to the "Receptionist" and you magically got everything you needed from there
         1. We found this role-based approach really didn't work in Azure AD, because nesting was so hit or miss
         1. To be consistent, we just stopped using group nesting altogether
      1. ðŸ‘‰Password changes on AAD-joined devices are...jarring
         1. The user is taken to a web page, and then you basically have to sign out and sign in again
         1. This makes new employee setup especially awkward, I think; they're not prompted when logging in to set a new password, and the only real indication that some action is needed is all of the cloud-connected apps (OneDrive, etc.) basically just don't work
1. ðŸ‘‰Intune
   1. Intune is not just GPO in the cloud; it's Mobile Device and Mobile Application managment
      1. Mobile device of course doesn't just mean tablets and phones; we're talking about Windows devices
