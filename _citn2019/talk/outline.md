1.	Introduction
    1. About Me
       1. Information Services Director for CWC, CS degree from Houghton College, been getting paid to do IT in one form or another for the last 9 years or so; experience working in Higher Ed, a bit in Fortune 500, and NPO
       1. Personal
    1. Overview
       1. Iâ€™m going to be sharing an IT Directorâ€™s perspective on moving from a traditional Microsoft Active Directory environment in a ministry setting to one powered by Azure AD, Intune, and Office 365
          1. Weâ€™ll focus mostly on identity management with Azure AD and Windows device management with Intune
          1. Our Intune discussion will be mostly limited to managing Windows, but weâ€™ll talk about how weâ€™re leveraging Azure AD to provide multi-platform authentication
          1. Not going to talk as much about O365, since many of us are already familiar and are likely living there (at least somewhat) already (and thereâ€™s lots of other opportunity here to learn about O365) 
       1. Goal is to share our experience, and Iâ€™m hopeful that youâ€™ll leave better equipped to apply Azure AD and Intune as appropriate in your environment.
          1. This wonâ€™t be an exhaustive treatment of everything Azure AD and Intune; thereâ€™s just too much to cover
          1. Iâ€™ll try to cover what I think will be most relevant to you, especially focusing on things that surprised, caught us off guard, or we found particularly helpful
       1. I am not an Azure AD and Intune expert; Iâ€™m sharing based on my experience in my environment. I donâ€™t know the best practices to apply these tools in every scenario, or the ins-and-outs of every situation.
          1. So, Iâ€™ve asked some of our vendors to join usâ€¦theyâ€™ll be able to provide insights from their perspectives working across many different clients (and, Iâ€™m sure, be quite happy to help you if youâ€™d like some more hands-on assistance getting up and running with these platforms)
