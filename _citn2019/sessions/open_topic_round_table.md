## ChMS/database management

* What does it take to get a person?
    * Nothing working right!
    * Need to have a dedicated person if you need it to work well
    * Internal hire
    * Should this be a "database" or "people" person?
        * Relational currency...ability to relate to ministry leaders and help solve problems (and understand product well enough to apply)

## Security Challenges/Deploying MFA

* IronScales - product to yank emails from inboxes
* Unrelated...some devices won't see Wi-fi 6 w/o firmware upgrade

## Teams Adoption

* Get buy-in from your organization's "West Wing"
    * "Donuts in the kitchen" announcements
* Three reasons for adoption:
    * Healthy habits: don't send SMS to people after hours, use teams instead (can silence those separately)
    * Get out of email thread messes
    * "Personal" team

## Entry-level training

* Created own training document, took people through class
    * Re-use that for new folks
* Common FAQs (for new hires)
* Outsource training
