* Scrum/agile is not about getting _more_ done...about getting the _right_ things done

## Scrum Pillars

1. Transparency
    1. Keep track of your daily/weekly tasks (example: Trello)
        1. Buckets: New, To Do, In Progress, Blocked, Done
            1. ðŸ‘†Kanban
        1. Use "interruption" to track interruptions
            1. Helps to track "offenders", but also helps you identify problem areas (maybe you shouldn't get interrupted about X as much)
        1. You should not actively be working on too many things at once ("In Progress" bucket)
    1. Daily Standup:
        1. _What did I do yesterday, what am I planning to do today, anything blocking me from getting this done?_
1. Inspection
    1. Does this task align with the church's or my personal vision?
        1. Are we running down a path we don't need to implement?
        1. Need to have _organization_ vision and _personal_ vision
    1. Weekly retrospective
        1. What worked? What didn't, what should I try, and what should I start doing?
1. Adaptation
    1. A "retrospective backlog"
    1. Move from reactive to proactive
        1. Need to be able to see trends to get ahead of things
        1. OK to start small; allocate even 5-10% of your time to get ahead of things
    1. 80/20 mentality: 80% of what you spend time working on is 20% of your job
        1. Don't be afraid to set aside intentional time for personal growth/long-term strategic sorts of projects (proactive)

## Misc Notes

* When leadership brings a task that will interrupt planned...let them make the decision for what gets cut!
* Burnout...can be hard to get through to those who don't understand what we do to get them to understand the time involved
