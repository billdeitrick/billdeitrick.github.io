## Teams

* Leadership buy-in!
* PowerShell script can get you a list of all files being touched by Teams (and paths to where in the tenant they're actually stored)
* O365 is such a moving target...change happens so quickly; plan on not being able to keep up. ðŸ™‚
* Delegate support; appoint a head "tech" person in each Team who supports others in Teams, let them bring bigger issues to you (instead of everyone bringing every issue to you)

## What makes a good IT director?

* "Yes" unless you have to say "no"
* Flexibility
* Project manager, able to bring in resources to fill in for their/team's deficiencies
* Networking (with people)
* Leading Up (and down)
* Have a seat at the leadership table to empower and equip

## Video storage/backing up

* Veeam may be able to help with this
* Deep Glacier, Google Drive (w/unlimited storage) are options
* SharePoint could be an option for video production and archiving

## Employee training

* Lynda for staff (or Linked-in Learning?)
    * Once a month Lunch and learn...use pre-existing content so you don't have to create it yourself!
    * Give people a one-month subscription to some paid learning service, like a library subscription...they have a month to complete the training
