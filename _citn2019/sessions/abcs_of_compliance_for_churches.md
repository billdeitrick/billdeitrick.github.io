## Why is compliance important?

* Legal risk
* Contracts with providers (CC merchants)
* If regulations don't apply...stewardship!

## Regulatory Standards, Policies, Processes

* Regulatory: states what you need to do (not how!)
* Policies: these are yours; address your specific response to requirements
* Processes/procedures address how you implement policies (how _we_ will do it)

## What is PII?

* Combination of two or more points of info about you
* With three pieces of info about you, almost guaranteed to be able to positively identify an individual
* Almost all regulations will cover this somehow

## PCI DSS

* Merchant: if you process cards, you're a merchant (in any form...face to face, mail/telephone, e-commerce, etc)
* Organization may require multiple SAQs; this is per-environment (online giving, in-person environments, etc.); need to evaluate and fill out appropriate SAQs for your environments
* Getting things out of scope is key!

## HIPAA

* Applies to anyone who creates, receives, maintains, or transmits ePHI (electronic protected health information)
    * Generally, from a HIPAA perspective, covered entities are ones providing care
    * If you have ePHI, even if not a provider, you should be taking appropriate steps (stewardship, reputation protection, etc.)
        * If this is in your ChMS, probably should be dialoging with your provider about this (especially if it's in something like a free text field/custom fields, etc.)
* Example when church might be covered:
    * Church-operated health clinics
    * Licensed counseling clinkics (esp. if take insurance)
    * Self-administered/funded insurace plans
* Three focus areas:
    * Administrative: who sees/touches it (analyze and inventory)!
        * Training, policy
    * Physical: access controls, media control, device control, etc.
    * Technical: Authentication, encryption, emergency access, audit control, etc.
* There is no technical specification for a product to be HIPAA compliant; it can help an org be compliant, but a product itself cannot be compliant

## GDPR, CCPA, WPA

* What are people's rights with regards to their data?
* General entities:
    * Individual (whose data is being stored)
    * Entities who collect/process data
    * Entities who process on behalf of primary entitie
    * Apply to data on citizens of: EU, State of CA, Washington State (or data stored in those jurisdictions)
* No examples of orgs without presence in Europe having GDPR legal action taken (yet)
* Right to be forgotten...you need to be able to remove someone's data!
* GDPR: Children's consent (under 16 need parent's approval, between 16 and 13 need both parent and child's approval)

## General Compliance Take-aways

* You have responsibility to steward data!
* All about securing personal data
* Start with defining [and enforcing!] policies for securing your data
* Encrypt everywhere
* Attendance and engagement data can get murky, especially if no explicit consent!! ðŸ‘ˆ
