* Demand seems to be going up, resources are going down!
* How do I do better with what I've been given, and better manage up and down?
* If you're managing people, do you recognize their abilities? Are you treating those people appropriately? One-size fits all doesn't work.
* How do we take where we're at and get better?

## Schedule Control

* Do you have an environment of focus?
    * In your office...
    * Do you keep a clean desk and know where stuff is?
        * Are you organized in a fashion that works for you?
        * Discipline!!
    * You need to keep control of your schedule!
* Multitasking
    * DON'T!!!
* Interruptions
    * Figure out ways to control your schedule
    * Position people between you and your interruptions
        * It's your job to constantly work yourself out of a job!
        * Don't be the bottleneck in the process...make it unnecessary for people to get to you when they need something!
    * Learn how to say "Go away" without being a jerk
    * Control them...don't let them drive you!
* Discipline
    * Routine...are you consistent with your time?
    * Do you wait until the last minute?
    * Do you put things in the same spot so you can easily find them later?
    * Do you derail yourself because you don't have a routine or plan?
    * We don't often account for the opportunity cost of what we're doing!
        * Need to plan schedules ahead to avoid conflict!

## Planning

* Stay organized!
* Tools:
    * Calendar -- no excuse for not getting things in your calendar!
    * Task list -- do things you need to do get captured somewhere? [waterproof notepad in the shower!!! üòÅ]
        * Don't waste your brain's CPU cycles trying to remember things you can write down...do what works for you!
    * Project List
        * Tasks are simple things that don't require a "reinvent", projects are more complex things that do require a "reinvent"

## Priorities

* Schedule your priorities!
    * Family time!
    * Consider scheduling "hallway time" to be interrupted!
        * Shows that you're here to serve, equip, and empower
* Stick with it!
    * Run your calendar out as far as you can!
* Manage exceptions
    * They will happen...workaround them and accept that they will happen, but don't live there
* Get help!
    * Ask your boss if need be, get a mentor outside your organization if need be
    * Humility is key...you will get it wrong; admit you make mistakes
    * When you get it wrong, admit it, fix it, and move forward
* Avoid traps
    * Different people/groups want your time
    * Let those groups get things figured out; pass it off on them, and let them take it up the chain, and then let them come back when they have an answer for you
* Communicate
    * Be able to go back up the chain..."I can do a, but not b and c. (but, I can do b and c the following week)."
        * Don't forget to do the things that you've said need to be done later!

## Q+A Ideas

* Establish office hours
* Dedicating time for projects vs tickets
    * Break day into three parts:
        * Helpdesk
        * Projects
        * Administrative overhead (patching, keeping the lights on, etc.)
